I have strong hatred for a lot of things, and I have caused my family so much stress and pain. I am toxic and controlling when it comes to my Fianc and I pray that he finds someone better. He deserves the best and I am FAR from it. I have been in and out of therapy for so long but I am just mentally fucked. I grieve for my parents, friends, fianc and everyone else who has had the displeasure of knowing me. I feel awful for everything I have done in life. I am a lowlife loser, I cannot seem to get the will to finish college, and work has me tired out. Anyways, my fianc is going into the military. I want to wait until he is gone, and pray that he does not find out until he finished training. I want to make it look like an accident or missing persons case. I do not want anyone to know I did it to myself. I am trying to figure things out. I hate trying to plan this, and I am hoping for some miracle that my next 20 days of intensive therapy can turn it around for me. I highly doubt it tho.

Please know there is nothing you can or could do.I am jealous of people in mental wealth wards. that is where I want to be. But I do not think I would qualify, as I am not outwardly a danger to myself or others. I have been through the healthcare system multiple times, and it only ever made me worse. I am on 100mg of sertraline and all it is done is made me more anxious and I cannot even enjoy music anymore. I cannot cry anymore, I cannot laugh anymore, I cannot cum anymore (TMI I know). I am convinced at this point there is nothing I can do to ever make things better. Not to sound like the joker lmao but society is fucked. I hate it. People are evil. Capitalism is evil. I do not want any part in this, and I would rather spend the rest of my life in isolation.I have attempted to end things twice before but failed. Once due to cowardice, and the second due to luck. I got better for a while, or at least I thought I did, but after COVID things have just completely collapsed and I am worse than I ever have been. I cannot deal with my brain constantly. I have no idea how I am supposed to navigate my way through this hellscape of a world with a brain that constantly makes things 10x more difficult. I am 21 years old, I am so anxious I cannot leave the house, unemployed, just dropped out of university, I have literally no friends, and all the friends I have had in the past I have ended up pushing away. I have nasty intrusive thoughts all the time, too awful to even say out loud. I am not comfortable in my own skin. I have no idea what I am doing with my life. I have tried so hard to do good and be good but I have realised the problem is not me, it is the world. The world is fucked and I do not want to be in it.So, I have a plan for tonight. I have got 20 packs of Aspirin and I am going to swallow as many as I can. I will wash it down with vodka. I am going to put my favourite album on and turn the volume up all the way. My parents will be out at the pub drinking and watching the football. I have never cared for football so it is not surprising to them that I am staying home. They will not be out all night though, and will probably return at 10 or 10:30pm. So, the way I see it, either they come home too late and I am already dead OR they come home, call an ambulance and I miraculously survive. At least then they will probably take me seriously and throw me in a ward where I belong.And yeah I am posting this for attention. Do I want pity? Yeah, probably. Just say you love me and tell me not to do it and feel sorry for me and all that. It will not do anything but at least it might give me a little bit of serotonin before I take the gamble.If you are suicidal yourself reading this, stop lurking this sub. Get help.

16169,"I was thinking about posting this in the BPD subreddit, but I felt it belonged here instead. My BPD is what is causing me to feel this way, if anyone else here has BPD they might relate.These feelings started about three years ago. I have gone through bad shit my whole life but just three years ago something happened that made me suicidal. I grew up in an abusive home and did not have many friends in high school, and that gives me a tendency to get overly attached to people. So when I got to college, everyone who lived on my floor hung out as a friend group and being part of that group made me the happiest I had ever been in my life. But that group turned around and was actually really mean and toxic to me, and because I was so attached to them, it made me suicidal when they were mean. They never actually said the words ""kill yourself"", but I really felt like they wanted me to do it. One symptom of my BPD, I think it is called splitting, I exaggerate things a lot and think in black and white. If someone does something mildly shitty to me, it makes me think that they are purposely trying to drive me to kill myself. I know that logically, even though they were definitely shitty people, they probably were not evil enough to try to make me kill myself. Very few people are actually that evil. (Similarly, I also do the opposite. If someone does something even slightly nice for me, it makes me think that they love me). Years later, during COVID, I started getting harassed online by that same group of people. And the harassment was actually really nasty, although again, they never actually said the words ""kill yourself"". I tried reporting it to the college administration and they did not care so I responded to the harassment, and they lied to the administration saying that I was harassing them for no reason, which again, seemed like a pretty evil thing to do, and I felt like because they were doing something that mean to me, it must mean that they want me to kill myself. I actually told them I wanted to kill myself because of them and they would not stop. The harassment really got to me, and it is a big group of people doing it, and I feel like if that many people want me to kill myself, then I should. I feel like everyone wants me to kill myself",Suicidal

35611,"In need of some advice/support Hey all! First I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub. I’ve been quietly reading your posts for months now and it is truly the reason I don’t feel so alone anymore. 
I’ve been dealing with health anxiety since I was 12. I saw a poster in the nurse’s office at school which explained the symptoms of menengitis and spent almost a year touching my chin to my neck to make sure I was okay.  Then, it turned into having anxiety about HIV/AIDS and lymphoma. My anxiety was so bad I had to drop out of my dream college because I couldn’t handle it. 
I felt happy for years after that. I focused on other things. But this January something changed. I suddenly began feeling everything I used to before. Constantly worried about various diseases even after being reassured that I was okay. 
It’s straining my relationships with my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. My constant reassurance seeking is making everyone lose their patience with me. I feel like I can’t handle it anymore. I sleep most of the day because that’s the only time when the terrible thoughts don’t come. 
The worst part is this feeling I like to call “happy...but”. It occurs in situations where I feel happy but cannot truly experience the moment for what it is because I’m worried. “I’m happy...but I could have a disease” “I’m happy... but it will only be for a little while until the anxiety comes back.”

35096,"Had a Panic Attack Last Night. Strange Sensation in Head. Anyone Ever Experienced Something Like it Before? Sorry for making another post so quickly after my last one. But I'm in a bad spot right now and I just need to talk about what I'm going through.


:Last night, I had a weird sensation in the left side of my head, above the ear. It felt like something was throbbing or pulsating inside my head. It was never painful and it would go away for a few minutes before coming back. I felt it until I went to sleep (where I thought something was going to happen to me in the middle of the night or I would die in my sleep.)


It doesn't help that right now, my current paranoia is a brain tumor or a unruptured aneurysm. Earlier this week I had a headache above my left eye around my eyebrow but that went away after a few hours. I've been incredibly anxious about that side of my head.


I woke up this morning and haven't felt it again, though I've been a nervous wreck all day fearing it would return. It hasn't so far, but I think I'm having hypersensitivity in that region cause it feels a bit fuzzy right now.

48200,"29M. Moved out for the first time in August to work at a ski resort for a year. I feel so lonely and have no real friends here.  (not saying people here are fake but I’ve become more of a hermit). Want to move back home and pursue schooling/certification (medical billing and coding). Feeling insanely depressed here.

So I made the move out here last year 2 months before turning 29. 

At first I enjoyed it. I’m able to buy weed whenever I want, I get a better pay than I did back home, and I don’t feel like a child living at home. And the weather was pretty nice.

But over time, it started wearing on me. I miss my nieces and every time we’ve factimed they look so much older. I feel sad that I’m not there. I miss my family and our family dog. Also I ran out of my ADHD/anxiety/depression medications and haven’t tried finding a new psychiatrist/therapist because I don’t want to deal with the hassle of searching around. 

I feel like I haven’t really connected to anyone here. I thought going out and snowboarding here at the resort almost everyday, that someone would recognize me and I’d make friends (which is what happened back home), but it hasn’t happened. I have no dating life at all. I get 3 or 4 days off a week and spend them alone. Sometimes I’ll game with my high school friends online, which is the only thing I really look forward to, but this fucks my sleep schedule even more.

I work overnights and barely get any social interaction anymore. I try sleeping during the day but it’s difficult because my neighbors like to play their music super fucking loud. Why don’t they just wear headphones?

My sleep schedule is shit. I hate going to run errands because I have to walk 15 minutes to my car. 

I snowboard for like 2 hours and then feel like going home because I get overwhelmed by the lengthy lines.

Once the season ends, they’ll switch me back to evenings as opposed to overnights, but then I’ll have to get a roommate. Having a roommate in these tiny ass dorms is horrible and I don’t like it. No privacy at all.

When I go back home, I want to start regularly going to therapy again, but am thinking “how can I do that if I don’t have a job”. How do I ensure I have a job when I get back home? I don’t live there right now so how the hell do I get interviews????",Depression

17337,"So, a bit about me: I am a 21 year old guy. Grew up in a family that strongly believes in academics to be the most important thing in life. Consequently, I had no lack of support from them for my studies, rather, saying ""I want to study"" was a common excuse for me to not do my chores. While I say excuse, I loved to study. We did not have internet or television, so most of what I read was textbooks provided by our school, and sometimes novels I took out of the school library. My school grades were top notch. The school itself was highly competitive, but when I graduated from high school, I had the fifth highest score in the school. Pretty good, everyone expects me to do well. I also did well in some entrance exams and got into a top university, studying CompSci.But that is where the happiness stops. The university is terrible at teaching, and that demotivated me from studying the subjects all by myself. The result? Terrible. My grades dropped. But still, they were not that terrible in my first year. I had a fail grade in one subject which I cleared. But then, that one fail grade completely demotivated me. I stopped paying attention to classes, and eventually stopped going to them. My friends and some of the better professors would ask me what is wrong, and I would do my best to avoid them. Eventually, I was scared to even go out lest I will meet some of my classmates or teachers. And the result was obvious, I failed all the classes that semester.Now, I was too scared to tell this to my family. They were bad enough when I had one failed subject last time, and warned me that I will be not allowed to continue studying and waste their money if I just wanted to fail. So I showed a fake grade sheet. And yes, they want to see the grade sheet or they will not pay for the next semester. I thought I would maybe clear those subjects one by one and they would not know. But now the shame of missing most of the classes in the last semester caught up, and I realised I could not concentrate in the classes at all. No one would talk to me voluntarily, and they would just answer very short when I ask something, and sometimes will not even do that. So eventually, that semester got fucked too.And this happened the next time too. I failed most of the subjects and had to fake my grades. But the university had terminated me, and I had to appeal for them to reinstate me. They did, and I had to retake the previous years subjects. But I did not know anyone from the class, and again, could not concentrate. I had planned to kill myself in the end of summer semester 2020, but because of the pandemic, we had to go back home. Back home, I pretended to be attending lectures while doing something else on my laptop. The last year I attended exactly 0 classes.Of course, my family thinks I am studying, but I am not. Remember I said I loved to read? Now I cannot even fucking concentration on reading something. Every night when I sleep, I promise myself that I will start studying tomorrow, but that never happens. The moment I open my textbook or some website to study, I lose all motivation. I cannot do it.Today was supposed to be the day I graduate and receive my degree. My family does not know. And they are one phone call away from knowing. we are not too rich, we cannot afford a regular psychiatrist. And anyway, I will be the one blamed, because that is how it has always been here. If I score low in a paper, it is because I did not study enough, not because I had a fever. I had a fever because I am too lazy to study. What do you think I will get when I say ""I have been failing for three years, I have just been faking my grades.""? I do not even have enough skills to find a job, and no one wants to hire a student who failed three years and could not get help for himself. And academics was the only thing I was ever good at.Frankly, every night I pray that I will not wake up alive. I do not have the guts to slice my wrist or stab myself in the heart or hang myself or something else. I have came close to completing those things, but I just cannot do it. I have ruined my life, and I hate myself.",Depression

People used to love looking at my art and sometimes I would get ""friends out of it"" but they would all just ignore me anyways after a week or two. And when talking about my interests no one cares and just talks about what they do and never ask what other things I like doing or if there is other things I do other than what I post on the internet. People around me do not even acknowledge me that much I til I mention I am upset. If they cared then they would not have to come in repair mode every fucking goddamn time. Instead I am stuck besides myself and my hobbies and I do not even really like the things I like anymore that much, so my mind wanders off to suicidal thoughts and wondering how life would be better without me at all in the picture. not even my boyfriend seems to acknowledge the pain I feel half of the time, and he knows I would drop anything I am doing and do anything for him. Like whatever I guess, I cannot talk about my pain without them adding it on with their own damn pain in the mix. Overall most of the time now I am a very nasty and overall more easily irritable now.

But I do not seriously think they want to really hear about what I am experiencing, because what I am experiencing is a fucking bummer.This post sounds bitchy- I am privileged to have people who care about me.

Upon coming closer to the cup, you realise that this substance is obviously hot buffalo sauce. You keep approaching the cup. What happens next leaves you shocked. The sauce shoots out of the top of the cup, in a perfectly straight cylinder, up into the sky. It is completely silent, and yet there is now an ever rising strange cylinder of hot buffalo sauce being created. The sauce appears perfectly stationary within itself, with the only things changing being its height. You cannot see any barrier that is keeping the sauce so straight. It appears as if it has a will of its own that allows it to maintain this shape. it is been several minutes, and you cannot see the top of the cylinder. You wonder, what will happen if I touch the cylinder? Will it collapse? Will it remain in place? You are not sure, but you think that if you can knock out the base of the cylinder, the rest of it might collapse. Or perhaps the stream of sauce would put a hole through your hand.
